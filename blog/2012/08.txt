====== 又两个grep的替代品: Rak和Grin ======
Created 星期四 30 五月 2013

@grep @cmdline @python

看这个意思，各种语言都要把grep重新实现一遍:

===== Rak =====
http://rak.rubyforge.org/

	Rak is a grep replacement in pure Ruby. It accepts Ruby syntax regular expressions and automatically recurses directories, skipping .svn/, .cvs/, pkg/ and more things you don't care about. It is based on the Perl tool ack by Andy Lester.


===== Grin =====

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/grin/

	A grep program configured the way I like it.
	
	I wrote grin to help me search directories full of source code. The venerable GNU grep and find are great tools, but they fall just a little short for my normal use cases.
	
	...Also, I was bored. It seems to be catching. Perl has ack, Ruby has rak, and now Python has grin

grin比ack好的一点是，ack缺省是按编程语言扩展名来搜的，一些它不识别的编程语言就得重新定义，所以常常临时需要用ack -a，而grin跟grep的行为比较一致，没有这个问题。
